```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## 1. Code a method f(x, y) that computes a value z, given an input tuple (x, y).
f <- function(x, y)  {
  z <- ((1 - x)^2) + (exp(1) * (y - (x^2))^2)
}

## 2. Code a method that visualizes the Rosenbrock function in 3D
x <- seq(-1, 1, length= 40)
y <- x
z <- outer(x, y, f)
z[is.na(z)] <- 1 # change non-defined elements to 1
persp(y, x, z, theta = 0, phi = 25, expand = 1, col = "lightblue")

## 3. Code a genetic algorithm, that attempts to find the global maximum of this function.
